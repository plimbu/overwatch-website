 created by Peter Limbu

###Installation
 the repo from git hub which had this README.md file and kept staging and committing until final product was ready, then I pushed to master dev and requested for pull request.

###challenges
Getting a modern design and spacing everything out in a nice aesthetic way was a challenge as well as resizing images and making sure they don't overflow out the screen. Other challengers include centring images and making sure images and text don't cover each other. To make the index page aesthetically pleasing and modern it took resilience and thought into each design decision.
